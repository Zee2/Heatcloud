HackIllinois 2018: Customer Engagement in 3D Heatmaps


Heatcloud is a tool that allows traditional business know-how, customer engagement testing, and advertisement prowess to be translated into 3D environments. In today’s industry, social networks, entertainment, and productivity software are built into VR, AR, and MR applications, existing in 3D environments. Traditional customer engagement tools are made obsolete by the introduction of additional dimensions for the customer to engage the product in. Imagine being able to A/B test a house.

Just as Facebook, Google, and Microsoft carefully examine how their customers interact with their websites, measuring how users click buttons and scroll websites, we can extend this traditional measurement process to cutting edge developments. Measuring the gaze of users while interacting with a webpage or an object has been done before, but that still leaves three more dimensions to explore. How users physically navigate 3D environments can be invaluable to developers, advertisers, and product managers. Finding “cold-spots” in an environment that users avoid, and hotspots that users cluster in, can allow developers to fix or exploit these areas.
