## HackIllinois 2018: Customer Engagement in 3D Heatmaps

Heatcloud is a tool that allows traditional business know-how, customer engagement testing, and advertisement prowess to be translated into 3D environments. In today’s industry, developers are innovating with VR, MR, and AR, bringing software into immersive 3D environments. However, as the cutting edge of immersive software continues to progress forward, traditional customer engagement tools have been made obsolete. The usual battery of engagement analysis has little relevance to modern, immersive XR applications. Thus, in order for developers, managers, and advertisers to properly take advantage of this exciting new development, we must improve the way we look at customer engagement. What do people look at in an immersive environment? Where do they like to explore? Where don’t they like to explore? What perspectives are the most rewarding and engaging? Imagine being able to A/B test a house.

Heatcloud allows developers and enterprise customers to gauge how users interact with the world around them, from examining small household objects to exploring large buildings. Heatcloud’s unique “vantage point” data allows for marketers to discover the most efficient ways to leverage advertising in virtual experiences. And, in the future, Heatcloud’s standardized voxel data can be used in machine learning datasets to classify user behavior with the advanced pattern recognition of today’s convolutional neural networks.


## Usage
Run Heatcloud and let your users explore the environment. See the 3D voxel cloud populate with gaze telemetry; save and restore your work to the Azure cloud.
