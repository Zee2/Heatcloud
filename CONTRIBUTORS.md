  I implemented the Blob storage in order to save previous runs so that the customer can go back and take a look at the data after the trials are over. I also researched the Azure Cognitive Services so that we can collect further data based on the test userâ€™s reactions while in the Virtual Reality atmosphere.

  I worked with Unity 2017 and Windows Mixed Reality to implement our voxel algorithm and the client side of the Azure storage system. Using the new Visual Studio Code I was able to rapidly prototype and develop new features for the product.
